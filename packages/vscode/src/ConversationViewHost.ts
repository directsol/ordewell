/**
 * The planner conversation the chat webview draws (#53), held on the host:
 * session events and local notices fold into core's view here, and the webview
 * only ever mirrors it.
 *
 * It goes out as block patches, not snapshots. A snapshot re-sends every block
 * — every command's full output — on each text delta, so a delta late in a
 * long session would cost the whole session so far. Core's reducer keeps each
 * untouched block's identity, so a patch costs only the blocks that changed.
 * Deltas also arrive faster than a frame, so patches wait `FLUSH_MS` and go out
 * as one per burst, which is one webview render rather than one per token.
 *
 * It also holds the queued prompts — what the user typed while a turn was in
 * flight — because they belong to this conversation: a reset or a reloaded
 * session drops them along with the view they were written against.
