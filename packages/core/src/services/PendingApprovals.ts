/**
 * The bridge between "core needs an answer" and "a human somewhere is looking
 * at a UI". Core cannot prompt: the human may be at a browser, a TUI, a CLI
 * stream, or a VS Code webview, and on the web server they are on the far end
 * of a socket. So the Session parks a promise here, announces the request
 * through the normal broadcast seam, and every surface answers through the
 * same `resolve(id, granted)` call.
 *
 * Timeouts are load-bearing rather than defensive: a planner turn that blocks
 * forever on an unanswered prompt would hang the whole research loop with no
 * visible cause. On expiry the request resolves to denied and the model gets a
 * normal, actionable tool result. A task runner's request is the exception
 * (ADR-0018, A1): the runner is parked on it rather than a research loop, and
 * it waits for a person — or the supervisor — however long that takes.
